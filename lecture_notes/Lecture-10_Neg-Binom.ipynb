    "We have a total of `n+r` elements, but one success MUST be planted at the end in order for our exit condition to be met. This means that we actually have one fewer elements to manipulate (`n+r-1`). The number of elements we can manipulate depends on our number of successes that we are interested, minus one for the exit. (`r-1`) Thus, the number of combos is $n+r-1 \\choose r-1$\n",
