    "\n",
    "The probability of an event happening is the number of ways an event can happen over a sample space (all possibilities in an \"experiment\").\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\frac{outcomes_A}{outcomes}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This naive definition assumes a finite sample size and that all outcomes are equally likely. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Multiplication Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication rule states that if there is a tree of probabilities (i.e. events happening after another) then the probability of each terminal node is equal to all of the probabilities that come before multiplied together.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. if choice 1 has 2 outcomes and choice 2 has 3 outcomes then the probability of any final node is $2 \\times 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when doing classical stats, you will find that you will take successive choices without replacement. This means that if you have a set of things you can choose from, with each successive choice you have one less that you can choose from.\n",
