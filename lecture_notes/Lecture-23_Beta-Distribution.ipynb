    "\n",
    "The Beta distribution is a generalisation of the Uniform distribution. It's very flexible which makes it very useful in modeling probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "PDF: $f(x) = c x^{a-1}(1-x)^{b-1}, 0<x<1$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll derive what the normalisation constant c is in another lecture. (I know that it's some combination of gamma functions which won't be covered until next lecture.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the beta distribution is a conjugate prior, meaning that if we use it as a prior in bayes rule we can often get the same sort of distribution back, which makes it useful for updating beliefs quickly and easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "(For more information about bayesian updates, see my talk that I have at the [Hamburg Data Science Meetup](https://github.com/SThornewillvE/Hamburg_DS_Meetup_Bayesian-Stats_Intro).)"
