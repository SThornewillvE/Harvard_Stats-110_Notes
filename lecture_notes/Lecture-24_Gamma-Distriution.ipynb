    "\n",
    "if a is an integer then $\\Gamma(a) = (a-1)!$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note as well that $\\Gamma(x+1) = x\\Gamma(x)$, which is kind of obvious if you know what a factorial is.\n",

    "## Point 2. The Gamma Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "All we need to do is make sure that the Gamma function integrates to one to make it a valid PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, we'll just find this for Gamma(a, 1) and then generalise to Gamma(a, $\\lambda$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(a)} x^a e^{-x} \\frac{dx}{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus if $Y \\sim \\textrm{Gamma}(a, \\lambda)$ and $Y = \\frac{X}{\\lambda}$,\n",

    "We can use a transformation from two classes ago to find the general case. We can express the X above in terms of $Y\\lambda$.\n",

    "$P(T_1 > t) = P(N_t = 0) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\leftarrow$ Note that this is the exponential form. (i.e. When the arrival of the first mail is after time t)\n",
